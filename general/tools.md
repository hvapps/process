# Toolset

In general - we're not religious about our tools.  If there is something that works better for you then use it.  But if you'd like to leverage our expertise and be more likely to get help, here's what we use.

**Note:** Client toolsets trump ours.  If a client prefers any tool that we aren't fond of, they win.

## Project Task Management

If a client has their own system, we use that.

Otherwise, we have accounts and are comfortable with any of the following:

* Basecamp
* Trello
* Github issue tracking

Try to **avoid** using Google spreadsheets for tracking tasks.

## Version Control

* Git / Github.  We recommend setting up with SSH from the command line.
* We use the [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) methodology for branches.  

## Design

We prefer to stick with vector based tools.  We can work with any of the following:

* Omnigraffle
* Adobe Illustrator
* Sketch

## Communication

* Avoid synchronous communication when possible
* Slack is preferred for most text communication
* We trust Slack, but not that much.  For anything that might require auditing in the future, use an email.  (e.g. a contract or important agreement)
* For video, anything but Skype.

## Office Productivity

We avoid the Microsoft suite when we can.  Too many of us hate it.

For standalone stuff, you can use Apple Pages or Numbers.

For collaborative work, use Google apps.
