# Meetings

## General meeting guidelines

* Recognize that meetings are the most intrusive, most synchronous, most expensive way to communicate.  They slow down the entire process because you must wait until all participants are available at the same time.  Avoid them when possible.
* If you need a meeting, then you should have a very good reason for using such an expensive process.
* If someone else suggests a meeting and you can think of a way to avoid it, suggest it!
* All meetings must have an agenda.
* Results of meetings, especially action items, should be posted to Slack immediately afterward.
* Conference call systems should be set up to start meetings three minutes early to allow participants to join and work through any potential technical issues.

## Standups and Scrums

Recognize that these types of meetings are very wasteful if they aren't kept as short as possible.  On a ten-person team, **a Scrum that uses an extra five minutes per day will waste well over $5000 in just ten weeks.**

**But:** regular standups of some form are a necessary part of keeping projects moving forward as quickly as possible.

Standups and scrums must be kept under ten minutes.  We use a Slack bot to remind everyone and coalesce their status.  Here's the process we use:

### Before the call:

Text in Slack:

1. Your status of what you're working on.  Link to tasks when applicable.
2. Identify any current or upcoming urgent needs.
3. Identify any people you need to speak with soon.
4. Explicitly, strongly identify anything that is blocking you from making forward progress.

Example:

`
Working on laying out storyboard for app.  (See task #25938)
Need to talk to @John and @Elaine ASAP about design assets
I'm going to be blocked by EOD if I don't have layout specs on the design.
`


### During the call:

Status calls are **not** the time to solve or even discuss problems.  They are used only to connect appropriate team members, or identify responsible parties for moving the project forward.

1. Do NOT wait for the leader or anyone else if they are late.  Start immediately on time and choose a leader if they aren't there.
2. No chit-chat.  Just do the scrum, and save water cooler time for later.
3. There is no need to repeat what you just typed.
4. The leader identifies who needs to talk to whom.
5. The leader reiterates any actions or blocking items and ensures that someone is on it.
6. The leader asks if there is anything someone has thought of that wasn't in their text.
7. The leader adjourns the call.  If anyone wants to stay on for water cooler chit chat now that's fine.  But the meeting is over.

### After the call:

The meeting leader posts a list of action items and required meetings.
Participants **should** complain if the meeting was more than 10 minutes.
