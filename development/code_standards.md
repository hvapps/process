# Code Standards

## General

* No tabs
* Indent = 2 spaces

### Testing

* The required level of unit or automated testing is highly project dependent
* In general, we love unit testing, but recognize that it isn't free
* So, test as needed but don't aim for 100% coverage

## Language specific

* If your language isn't here, add a style guide.  Don't invent one.  Find your favorite style guide on the interwebs and we'll use that.  If these style guides get out of date or you have a good reason for using another one, let us know.
